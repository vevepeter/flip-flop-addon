# Flip Flop Addon

This is a simple Vev addon that can flip elements horizontally and/or vertically, and/or invert all colors.

To test this or keep working on it: 
 * Install the Vev CLI
   * `npm i -g @vev/cli`
 * Authorize
   * `vev login`
   * You need to already have a Vev account to do this
 * Set up the Widget Package
   * `vev init`
 * Fire it up
   * `vev start`

Go to [Vev](https://editor.vev.design) and open a new or existing Project, you should then see the Addon either in the Add menu or by clicking the "Local developer" (a blue circle) button at the bottom.

This source code is open and free to copy, change and share for both personal and commercial use.
